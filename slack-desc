extra-cmake-modules:
extra-cmake-modules: The Extra CMake Modules package, or ECM, adds to the
extra-cmake-modules: modules provided by CMake, including ones used by
extra-cmake-modules: find_package() to find common software, ones that can be
extra-cmake-modules: used directly in CMakeLists.txt files to perform common
extra-cmake-modules: tasks and toolchain files that must be specified on the
extra-cmake-modules: commandline by the user.
extra-cmake-modules: In addition, it provides common build settings used in
extra-cmake-modules: software produced by the KDE community.
extra-cmake-modules: While the driving force of this module is to reduce
extra-cmake-modules: duplication in CMake scripts across KDE software, it is
extra-cmake-modules: intended to be useful for any software that uses the CMake
extra-cmake-modules: build system.
